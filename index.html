                            We stand out by offering only the best line of decking for our customers. By using Azek TimberTech®, we're able to build long lasting, durable, and weather resistant decks. Azek TimberTech®'s vintage decking is up 30% cooler than other decking material, keeping you cooler in hotter weather. We also aim for sustainability, using decking material containing recycled material!

                                    When you choose a TimberTech® Advanced PVC deck, you'll get boards without wood fibers, leading to a lack of rotting in the deck boards. These boards are made out of PVC, letting the boards be cooler to the touch than wood deck boards.*

                                    <i>*Although TimberTech® Advanced PVC decking is cooler to the touch than many other deck board products, all decking products will get hot in the sun. Additionally, the darker the decking color, the hotter it will feel. For hotter climates, consider choosing a lighter color.</i>
