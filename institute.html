            <h4>What is Institute?</h4>
            <p>
                Institute is a class taught by a local church member where we delve into deep discussions about the gospel, the plan of salvation, church history,
                and any other topic relating to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Another wonderful aspect about institute is being able to meet and
                socialize with other amazing individuals! Most people arrive early and stay late to converse with one another. <b>Dinner is provided!!</b>
